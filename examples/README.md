# Minecraft BASIC examples

The files in this directory are example programs written in Minecraft BASIC.

To run these programs:

*   First, you need to be running Minecraft
    with the Minecraft BASIC Mod installed.
    (`./gradle runClient` might work for you;
    if not, go up one directory and read the `README.md` file there.)

*   Make a world and start the game. Superflat worlds work best for these examples!

*   Then type `/run /FULL/PATH/TO/MinecraftBasic/examples/box.basic` and hit enter.

That's it. That program is a very, very simple one:
it'll make a little stone box near where you're standing. 

*If you write a cool program in Minecraft BASIC, please let me know about it.*
I'd love to have more neat examples for this directory.
